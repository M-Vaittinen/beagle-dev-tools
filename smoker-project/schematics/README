Note.
The food temperature measurement circuit connects food temperature probe (NTC
connected to board using 3.5mm jack, J2) to high end of a voltage divider. This
works only when food temperature probe's cord / probe itself is isolated from
the jack's tip/sleeve. Unfortunately many probes seem to not be doing this.

I guess the circuitry would work (better) with more probes if the food probe
was added to GND side of voltage divider, so that the part of connector which
is connected to cord would be at GND. (I should check whether it is tip or
sleeve). This would require modifying the resistance and temperature
computations.
