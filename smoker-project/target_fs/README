This directory contains scrpts/binaries copied from my BBB's back-up filesystem.

Note - this does (probably) not contain C or dts sources. Just scripts and
binaries.

Note - network setup scripts are not included. How to connect to your
WLAN is up to you.

Oh - I did also attempt using hostapd to add a hotspot by the BBB and by
just connecting a device to this AP. (I even used dnsmasq to add domain name
for the BBB). Unfortunately many devices (phones) were too smart. They attempted to reach some server(s) and decided the AP connection was not working as it should && dropped the connection. If someone has the time to create reliably working hotspot - I am interested in merging that solution to here :]
