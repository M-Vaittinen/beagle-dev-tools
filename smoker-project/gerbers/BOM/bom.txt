Meat temperature probe:
NTC type meat temperature probe with 3.5mm jack.
NOTE: current schema/gerber connects the probe to high side of voltage divider,
thus the cord/probe must not be connected to ground pole of connector. This
is a nasty issue because most of the probes are. (You can test this by
multimeter - just try with beeber setting if cord/probe are connected to tip or
sleeve of the jack. If yes, then the probe does not suit with the current
schema/code. I have only managed to get one probe which suits this use and
unfortunately I don't remember where I bought it :(
