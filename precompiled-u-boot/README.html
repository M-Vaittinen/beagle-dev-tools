<h1>Here&rsquo;s a u-boot binary which can be used on beagle bone black if you don&rsquo;t want to compile your own.</h1>

<ul>
<li>Copy the binaries and uEnv.txt to your SD card boot partition.</li>
<li>Edit the uEnv.txt file so that server IP address, NFS share path etc match to your server settings.</li>
</ul>


<h4>If you don&rsquo;t have SD card with suitable boot partition, you can create it accirding to instructions below:</h4>

<h3>Prepare a boot partition to SD card as explained here:</h3>

<p>or</p>

<h4>(Text below is copied from one of the links above)</h4>

<blockquote><p>Insert the microSD Card into your computer and observe which device it registers as by typing
<code>
ls /dev/sd*.
</code>
If you are uncertain, remove the microSD Card and the entry should go away. Once you know which device your microSD Card is, follow the instructions below replacing /dev/sdX with the name of the microSD Card in your system.
Begin partitioning the microSD Card by typing
<code>
fdisk /dev/sdX
</code>
   Initialize a new partition table by selecting o, then verify the partition table is empty by selecting p.
   Create a boot partition by selecting n for &lsquo;new&rsquo;, then p for &lsquo;primary&rsquo;, and 1 to specify the first partition. Press enter to accept the default first sector and specify 4095 for the last sector.
   Change the partition type to FAT16 by selecting t for &lsquo;type&rsquo; and e for &lsquo;W95 FAT16 (LBA)&rsquo;.
   Set the partition bootable by selecting a then 1.
   Next, create the data partition for the root filesystem by selecting n for &lsquo;new&rsquo;, then p for &lsquo;primary&rsquo;, and 2 to specify the second partition. Accept the default values for the first and last sectors by pressing enter twice.
   Press p to &lsquo;print&rsquo; the partition table. It should look similar to the one below.</p>

<p>   Disk /dev/sdb: 7948 MB, 7948206080 bytes
   255 heads, 63 sectors/track, 966 cylinders, total 15523840 sectors
   Units = sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
   Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
   I/O size (minimum/optimal): 512 bytes / 512 bytes
   Disk identifier: 0xafb3f87b</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>   Finally, commit the changes by selecting w to &lsquo;write&rsquo; the partition table and exit fdisk.</p>

<p><strong>Format the Partitions</strong></p>

<p>   Format partition 1 as FAT by typing
<code>
mkfs.vfat /dev/sdX1
</code>
   Format partition 2 as ext4 by typing
<code>
mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdX2
</code></p></blockquote>
