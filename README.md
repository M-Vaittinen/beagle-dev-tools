# BBB controlled electric smoker

NOTE: This repository contains instructions which must not tested in real
operation. These are provided only for academic interest. Electricity can
kill and these designs are NOT approved for any use. Do not try them.

Furthermore - there is zero security effort put in this device. If you use
even just the software described here you are risking the privacy of your
WIFI network.

Please note. I haven't uploaded complete control SW for BBB. I will try to work
getting this repository up-to-date and oranized. This will take a while though.

Feel free to drop me a note at mazziesaccount@gmail.com if you find this
interesting :)
